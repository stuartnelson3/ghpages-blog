**Location**: Sourbrodt -> Viersalm

It rained several times in the night. Despite my inability as an outdoorsman,
my tarp kept me dry. Excepting waking up cold between 5am and 7am (cf. previous
comment on bivouac sacks), I slept well.

I broke camp around 9:30am. I had only drunk two of the three beers from the
previous night, so I had a Leffe with breakfast. Breakfast was a bit of peanut
butter with some dried cranberries.

Given the successes of my previous day, I decided to follow national bike
routes today. Belgium is criss-crossed by bike routes both national and
international, which are paved, well marked, and never take you far from
campsites or places with food and water. Essentially, by day 3, I had abandoned
the [original route](https://bikepacking.com/routes/ardennes-arbalete/) that
brought me here and started free styling my own route based on an arbitrary
destination.

I had calibrated my time/distance estimation based on the preceding two days.
Riding the national routes was completely different. It was not difficult to
ride 25km in an hour, for example, which saw me passing by potential lunch
points two hours before I was hungry.

I reached Malmedy at 11:30am and bought a quiche and pain au chocolat. I sat by
the cathedral and had my early lunch, and was starting to feel better about the
new direction of my trip. I was not confident in being able to handle the
original route, and picking each morning where I wanted to be in the evening
left the trip open to change.

The paths I took were empty. Hour long stretches drifted by without seeing
another person.

My destination for the evening was Viersalm, and a campsite there. The campsite
cost an outrageous 8 euros, but I supposed I could afford it. I dropped off my
gear, unrolled my tarp and bivoauc sack so they could dry, and headed into the
town.

On a beautiful day I was rewarded with an excellent terrace overlooking a lake.

There was a list of local beers I had never heard of. Looking around, the most
popular beer appeared to come in a glass horn. Naturally, I had to have one.

Beating a wobbly retreat, I passed through the grocery store for dinner. Meal
in tow, I returned to my campsite to shower, eat, and sleep.

Noticing the piles of food wrappers and empty bottles outside the nearby tents,
I realized that keeping food away from animals was not a concern.
